            Picture this: you’ve inherited a Git repository for a project with no documentation, no guidance, and no clue where to start. Or perhaps it’s an old side project of your own, one you hastily put aside and can barely remember. The HEAD isn’t pointing to a stable version, branches are everywhere, and the app itself is riddled with issues, refusing to run. Without a clear understanding of which branch is ahead or which commit might hold a functional state, you’re stuck.

This tutorial dives deep into solving..                    </p>
