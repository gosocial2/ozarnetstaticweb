<h3>Supercharge Your Object-Oriented PHP Development</h3>
<p>Are you looking for a way to drastically cut down on the time you spend on routine PHP coding tasks? Then get ready for the latest evolution of your favorite rapid web application development tool! We're thrilled to announce the arrival of <strong>CodeIgniter Wizard 3.x</strong>, packed with exciting new features, significant improvements, and essential bug fixes to elevate your CodeIgniter development experience.</p>
<p>For those new to the magic, <strong>CodeIgniter Wizard</strong> is a powerful, Mac-only desktop application designed for rapid web application development using the CodeIgniter framework. It's a <strong>RAD tool and CRUD code generator</strong> that takes your MySQL or MariaDB database as input and automatically generates the boilerplate code for models, views, and controllers, even CodeIgniter 4 entities. This allows you to quickly create database-driven web applications with full <strong>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)</strong> functionality and administrative interfaces, saving you weeks or even months of coding time.</p>
<p>Now, let's dive into the exciting updates that <strong>version 3</strong> brings to the table:</p>
