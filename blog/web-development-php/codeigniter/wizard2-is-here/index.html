                                                <p>CodeIgniter Wizard 2.0.7 has been released  to fix a couple of reported bugs reported by active users of version 2.0.x soon after it was unveiled on 30 August 2022. With a large number new features added to the application, the time needed to showcase them increased more than ten-fold. Authentication &amp; authorization, secure file uploads for the end user, automatic image resizing post-uploads, language localization and translation in the GUI with the ability to add unlimited number of languages and locale variations, are just to name a few of the new features.</p>
<p>Here is the first video prepared for this major update which demonstrates a new end-to-end process of creating a simple web application featuring demonstrations for not just some of the less known features like AJAX-based lazy loading of list views, but also new features like integrating authentication, authorization, and image file uploads with automatic image size shrinking.</p>
