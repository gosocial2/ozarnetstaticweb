                        <p>Welcome to CodeIgniter Wizard for Mac.</p>
                        <p>
                            CodeIgniter Wizard is a PHP developer utility that helps quickly generate an advanced starting point for MySQL database-driven web applications with administrative interfaces by generating the most commonly used boilerplate code for CRUD operations and HTML files.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With its database-first approach, the wizard asks you to select the tables and fields you want to include in your application, and then it automatically generates the necessary models, views, and controllers - even the new CodeIgniter 4 entities, supporting standard database CRUD operations, that is, create, read, update and delete. It even populates sidebar and (dashboard) home pages automatically with some basic data from your modules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A design-first approach is also planned for an upcoming release in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CodeIgniter Wizard generates most of the time-consuming boilerplate code needed for the basis of the backend of most web applications which will save you weeks if not months! You can then take the generated project and keep developing using the base code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most important of all, you are not bound to any CodeIgniter Wizard-specific libraries or base classes to further develop your application. Every code file CodeIgniter Wizard generates is standards-based, generic, secure, re-useable, yet simply replaceable.
                        </p>

                        <p>The web applications created with CodeIgniter Wizard are PHP code using version 4.x of the the open-source CodeIgniter framework. Although CI Wizard does not require a PHP environment to generate code files forming a web app, the code generated with it does.</p>

                            CodeIgniter Wizard will run on macOS 10.13 or later (it is also optimized for macOS 12 Monterey), and it currently supports only MySQL / MariaDB for the database platform at design time. So you need to have access to a MySQL or MariaDB Server v.5.5 or later over either your local network or the Internet (SSH tunneling option not available). <br>
                            Ideally, a local MySQL would be present on your Mac, however, it is not required. You can use any MySQL/MariaDB server on your network and user account to which you have direct access (SSH-tunneling-only access is not supported by CodeIgniter Wizard, though).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CodeIgniter Wizard currently does not create, modify or delete schemas, tables, and users on your database servers which you have to do by yourself either using a free GUI tool like MySQL Workbench, Sequel Ace (aka Sequel Pro), or a premium tool such as <a href="https://www.arcler.co.uk/navicat/?r=ciwizappHelp">Navicat</a> or simply by using the command line.

                            While it is possbile to configure the CodeIgniter framework itself to use multiple databases / schemas, CodeIgniter Wizard currently supports one database schema per web application. If you need to develop and deploy a web application using multiple databases and use some entity models using one database and the others another, this is possible by manually customizing a web application previously generated with the wizard in a IDE or external editor. (In fact this is how the CMS of the <a href="https://www.ozar.net">Ozar.net website</a> currently works). More information on such a configuration is in <a href="https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/connecting.html#connecting-to-multiple-databases" title="Connecting to Multiple Databases from CodeIgniter">the CodeIgiter 4 documentation</a>.

<p>Suffixing all controller class names with 'Controller' as in 'CityController' is a good practice so that the generated file name would not be confusing because of another possible file with the same name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Publishing your CodeIgniter4 web applications directly in a <b>shared&nbsp;</b><em>htdocs</em> (or <em>www</em>) directory of a web server such as MAMP or XAMPP is a bad practice and a security flaw. (You should always create a virtual host pointing to the <em>public</em> directory of your web application, and set your URL accordingly such as <code>http://yourapplication</code>). <br />However, if you end up not using a virtual host for any reason, your routes and some of the URL links in your web application may not work properly even if you have set your application URL to http://localhost/yourapplication/public .

                        <p>A database record is the first building block in CodeIgniter Wizard as all the applications you are going to create will need a database.</p>
                        <p>CodeIgniter Wizard generates your application's models, controllers, and views based on the data it reads from the database you register.</p>
                        <p>Currently only MySQL and MariaDB are supported.</p>
                        <p>CodeIgniter Wizard has been tested with MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10. The compatibility of web applications generated with CodeIgniter Wizard is the same as the CodeIgniter framework's own compatibility range.</p>

                        <p>CodeIgniter Wizard does not install or set up database servers, nor does it create, modify or delete schemas, tables, and DB users on your database servers. You need a MySQL / MariaDB server up and running beforehand, and have access to it with necessary privileges on a given schema. You can then use a free GUI tool like MySQL Workbench, Sequel Ace (aka Sequel Pro), or a premium tool such as Navicat, or simply by using the command line (Terminal.app) to create your tables.</p>
                        <p>Your database server can either be installed on your local computer, or a computer on your network, or even on a hosting server (or cloud) accessible on the Internet.</p>

                        <p>Since user authentication features along with language localization and e-mail setup has been added as of version 2.0 of CodeIgniter Wizard, creating a new web app has now become a five-step process where you need to specify the appropriate settings.</p>
                        <h5 id="basic">Basic Settings</h5>
                        <p>Fill out the basic information for your application on this form, such as the application's name, the database it uses, theme and the framework version. Please note that once you click 'Save...' at the end of all steps of the form, the database you have chosen here cannot be changed later for this very application, so decide carefully. (If you need to use a different database later, you will then need to create a new web application.)</p>
                        <p>Below is the detailed breakdown of the fields you need to fill in.</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Application name:</dt>

                            <dd>Select a database from the dropdown list. The database(s) you have previously "registered" will pop up in this menu.</dd>

                            <dd>Currently, only CodeIgniter 4.x is supported. If you would like to have CodeIgniter 3.x there as an option, you can submit a feature request and/or sign a petition for us to consider adding this.</dd>

                            <dd>Ability not to use this option has been deprecated in a previous version, and now defaults to checked. Your application's view files will use layout template format (which is similar to Laravel's blade template files except for the mustache-like double curly brace syntax ).&nbsp;</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <h5 id="langSettings">Language Settings</h5>
                        <p><picture> <source type="image/webp" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/createNewWebAppLanguageSettings-dark-normal.webp" /> <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/createNewWebAppLanguageSettings-dark-large.png" /> <img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/createNewWebAppLanguageSettings-dark-large.png" alt="Language Settings when starting to create a new web application" /> </picture></p>
                        <p>This is where you specify the primary spoken language of your new web application. The languages you defined in 'Global Languages and Translation Templates' will show up in the pop-up menu. There are two additional options in this context:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use string localizations / translations:</strong> This option should be checked if your web application's primary language is not English or your application will be multi-lingual.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepend locale to all URIs, prefixing all routes with the determined locale:</strong> Checking this is strongly recommended if your web application will be multi-lingual. This option will create routes, that will have a parent route with a URI segment corresponding to an alternate locale. For example, if you have a customers module and five languages set, a URL for Spanish can be http://yourapp/es/customers where as the German version would be <code>http://yourapp/de/customers</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 id="location">Location</h5>

                        <p>This is the section where you need to specify the path and folder to your application in the Finder and the URL.</p>
                        <p>Once your selection is complete, the last folder name in the path will show up in the next field labelled 'Application Folder Name' so you will know the exact full path set.&nbsp;</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Application folder path:<br></dt>

                                <p style="margin-top: 0.41em;">Click the ellipsis (...) button next to the corresponding field. This will bring up macOS' default file &amp; folder selector dialog box, where you can specify the path to your application. The path must be inclusive of your application's own folder, so in most cases, you will typically need to create a new folder inside the folder selector dialog panel, and carefully name it as the folder of your application so that its name does not contain spaces and special characters.</p>
                                <p>Once your selection is complete, the last folder name in the path will show up in the next field labeled 'Application Folder Name' so you will know the exact full path that was set.</p>
                                <p>You can change this by clicking the ellipsis button again before you 'Save...'.</p>

                            <dd>You cannot change the value in this field directly as it is set using the ellipsis (...) button as described right above. (You can select by highlighting, and copy the folder name though)</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Application URL:</dt>
                            <dd>This is the base URL of your web application. It is <code>'http://localhost:8080'</code> by default. If you run the command 'php spark serve' in the root directory of your web app folder in a command-line Terminal, your app will immediately be accessible using PHP's built-in web server, via this URL. <br /><br />You can change it to whatever your web server is configured for if you are using a web server such as Apache. <br /><br />E.g. if you are using an AMP stack such as XAMP or MAMP for your server, and just want to use the default htdocs directory, you may want to create your web app inside its own directory under htdocs, and then set the URL to http://localhost/yourapp <br /><br />Avoid a trailing slash at the end of the URL, as CodeIgniter 4's base_url() and site_url() functions forcibly return a URL without the trailing slash (as opposed to CodeIgniter 3) which may lead to SEO-related issues if you are publishing to the Internet.</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <p>You can also specify a "starting URI segment" which means that the wizard will generate code under the sub directories you specify in this segment. For example, if you specify "admin" (without double quotes), and you create a "customers" module, &nbsp;its module code generated by the wizard will be accessible via <code>http://yourapp/admin/customers</code>.</p>

                        <p>You can "include an authentication &amp; authorization system" by checking the appropriate checkbox. This option requires localization option to be checked as generate code features localized strings.</p>
                        <p>You can also choose to have the wizard create an admin user with the user name and e-mail you specify in the appropriate fields.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                            The wizard will then include all the necessary code in your web app for the following features:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="help">

                        <p>Here you specify the settings which CodeIgniter will be using when programmatically sending e-mails - for example when a user signs up or requests a password reset. Myth Auth framework used for authentication and authorization also uses these settings.</p>
                        <p>When you are done, click 'Save...', and then you will be taken to the next screen where you can start adding modules to your new web application. Saving will create the new project within the wizard app, but will not yet output any files to the Finder location (folder) you specified.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3 class="title">Global Languages and Translation Templates</h3>
                        <p>The i18n / localization settings that would be applied to all of the web applications and code you will be creating in CodeIgniter Wizard.</p>
                        <p>The languages that appear (or added by yourself) in this window are the languages that will be made available to your own web applications you create in CodeIgniter Wizard. Each application you create has an identical 'languages and translations' window very similar to this.</p>
                        <picture> <source type="image/webp" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/translation-templates-light-normal.webp" /> <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/translation-templates-light-large.png" /> <img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/translation-templates-light-large.png" alt="Global Languages, translation files and translated strings" /> </picture>
                        <p>Under each language in this window, there are translation file templates the primary one of which is called 'Basic' and these files are created for every language you define here. The 'Basic' translation file template contains default translation strings under the parent key named 'global'. The default strings nested under Basic.global are pre-translated for English, French and Turkish languages. For other languages you add, you would need to translate these string for that language by yourself.</p>
                        <p>It is strongly recommended that you do your translations in this 'Global Languages and Translation Templates Window' first, so that you wouldn't have to repeat the work for each application. You can also backup your translations exporting them as JSON files, so that if you reset your computer or use CodeIgniter Wizard on a different device, you can import those JSON files to pick up where you left off.</p>
                        <p>When you create a translation file template or a translation string key in this interface, an instance of the item for each language will be created automatically. For example, if you create a translation file named "Customers" under German, the same file will be created for each language automatically. Edits, however, are individual, meaning editing a selected item will only edit that item and not its copies under different languages.</p>
                        <p>Because CodeIgniter makes use of nested translation keys, same logic applies in this interface allowing you to create child keys under a parent key. While changing and swapping parents of a translation key is not impossible, it is an error-prone task and is not recommended.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Please note that JSON file import will allow translation strings to be nested under at a maximum of 3-levels deep.</p>

                        <h3 class="title">MVC Modules in CodeIgniter Wizard</h3>

                        <p>In CodeIgniter Wizard, the building blocks of your application are called <em>modules</em> and they consist of a model, an entity, a controller and view files for form and listing (data table) section of your modeled entities.</p>
                        <picture> <source type="image/webp" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/codeigniter-wiz2-modules-light-normal.webp" /> <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/codeigniter-wiz2-modules-light-mid.png" /> <img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/codeigniter-wiz2-modules-light-mid.png" alt="Modules in CodeIgniter 2.0" /> </picture>
                        <h4 class="help-subtopic" id="creating" class="help-subtopic">Creating a Module</h4>
                        <p>To create a module, click the 'Create...' button at the bottom left of the modules list. You will then be presented with a modal window to define the components of your new module. Also make sure the database server is up and running during this process.</p>
                        <p><picture> <source type="image/webp" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/newModuleInCIWiz2-light-normal.webp" /> <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/newModuleInCIWiz2-light-large.png" /> <img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/newModuleInCIWiz2-light-large.png" alt="Creating a New Module in CodeIgniter 2.0" /> </picture></p>
                        <p>At the top of the window, there are fields to specify the module name, single object name, plural object name, controller name, model name and entity name. These fields will have default values based on the table name.</p>
                        <p>CodeIgniter Wizard will smartly try to determine if the tables in your database have table prefixes and whether the table name is singular or plural, and then it will initially infer singular nouns for entity and model classes, and a plural form of the noun for controllers and the module name.</p>
                        <p>Although you can change these with whatever naming you like, it is recommended that you stick with the recommended pattern for the semantics of MVC paradigm.</p>
                        <p>Now select a database table from the pop-up menu at the top-left of this window.<br /><br />This will read all the columns from the database and populate the table below with a matrix of fields to include or exclude in your model. Corresponding check-boxes at the beginning of each row indicate whether code should be generated for the given field. You can even specify column numbers for forms and ordering. At the end of each row, there are pop-up menus to chosse the form field type and input type.</p>
                        <p>If a database column has foreign keys defined in the database, the corresponding form field can be created as a dropdown select controls in the forms, instead of <code>input type="text"</code>.</p>
                        <p>CodeIgniter framework has some form helper functions in PHP which contributes to creating clean and concise code for form views. CodeIgniter Wizard can create code for form pages using this feature, or it can create generic form objects using just HTML and PHP. The advantage of the former is clean but CodeIgniter-specific code, the advantage of the latter is that it would give you portable code most of which could also be used outside CodeIgniter. Therefore tick the checkbox labelled "Use back-end framework's own form helpers for view generation" if you want CodeIgniter-specific code.</p>
                        <p>'Form orientation in views' determines to choose between Bootstrap's vertical and horizontal form style. When horizontal is selected, "form-horizontal" CSS class added to thetag and form labels are placed right to the left of input fields. In vertical orientation, labels are placed at the top of each input.</p>
                        <p>You have the ability to change the order of rows in this table by dragging up or down. For this reason, clicking in a text field inside a row to edit it takes about a second longer. That's because the app will first try to determine whether the click was for dragging the row or editing a text field.</p>
                        <p>When you are done with these settings, click "Generate Code" at the bottom-right. This will create code for model, views, controller and an entity linked to the model.</p>
                        <p>The generated code at this stage will not show up anywhere but will be stored in application data. In order to get them written to the file system, you will need to publish the module.</p>
                        <h4 class="help-subtopic" id="editing">Editing an Existing Module</h4>
                        <p>Editing a module is mostly identical to creating it except that the database table will be pre-selected in the corresponding dropdown menu. All of your previous configuration will re-appear in the fields matrix.</p>
                        <h5 id="fieldOptions">Field Options (New in v2.0)</h5>

                        <p>For fields with form input type="file", you can define "file uploads" as shown in the screenshot.</p>

                        <h5 id="textareaOptions">Text area options</h5>
                        <p>You can set up text areas to allow HTML and/or JavaScript so that after form submission entered HTML tags or script tags are not stripped out.</p>
                        <h6 id="radioButtons">Radio Buttons</h6>
                        <p>Coding radio buttons in HTML is a cumbersome task - especially when using a responsive layout with form controls grouped in nested div tags. Luckily CodeIgniter Wizard makes their creation very easy. In order to be able to have them generated, you need to define a data source for them, either by entering static key-value pairs by yourself, or specifying a database table to dynamically generate multiple choices (to select one) for the end user. How to achieve this is described in the next paragraph.</p>
                        <h5 id="dropDownMenus">Setting Up Dropdown Menus and (Input) Radio Buttons</h5>
                        <h5>Setting Up a Field to Pull Data from Another Database Table</h5>
                        <p>The database table of your module might have foreign key references to joined tables in which case CodeIgniter Wizard will automatically generate the necessary code to bring data referring to many-to-one relationships so that if your module has a field with a foreign key referencing another table. Alternatively you can use the "External Data Source" options to have dropdown select menus or input radio buttons generated in the form views of your web application. Also in the 'Application Module' window of CodeIgniter Wizard, dropdown menus under the columns 'referenced table', 'referenced PK' and 'choice label' within the generated fields table view will allow you to specify tables and columns to join without the need of a foreign key definition inside the database. In cases where you chose 'Dropdown' or 'input' &amp; 'radio' combination under the "Create as" column and checked the radio button labelled "From another DB table" under 'External Data Source', the wizard will add code to display a name instead of the PK / ID column, by forming an SQL query referring also to the joined tables, also assuming, however, the module for the external table - which in this case is 'Cities', will also have been created by you.</p>
                        <p>Currently CodeIgniter Wizard does not automatically generate modules for tables externally referenced to the primary table. You would need to manually ensure that related models and entities are present in the project - if not, just create a new module and select the related table to quickly create one. To summarize, if you have joined tables via foreign keys, and if you want the referenced tables automatically display a more human-friendly name than just its ID, you must make sure all the following conditions met:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make sure either 'Dropdown' or 'input' &amp; 'radio' is selected next to field name under 'Created as'</li>
                            <li>CodeIgniter wizard will automatically infer the ID of the referenced field, and it will make a guess which field will be the name field to refer to the related object (e.g. 'name', 'title', 'label', 'designation')</li>
                            <li>If the wizard did not pick a good column / field for the name/title/label, you can manually pick the correct table column as the name field)</li>
                            <li>When you are done with the module settings, click 'Generate Code and Close'. Next, create a module for the referenced table, and be sure not to exclude the field which will serve as the object's human-friendly name (e.g. 'name', 'title', 'label', 'designation', etc.)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5 id="staticOptionsSetUp">Setting Up a Field to Display a List of Static Key Vale Pairs</h5>
                        <p>You can have your dropdown menus or input-radio buttons display data from a static list you define. Just click the tiny square button next to "From static values..." under 'External Data Source' column, and enter your strings as key-value pairs in the pop-up menu that will show-up. As much as it is intuitive, you can simply 'Save and Close' to have your settings applied. Please note that if you close the underlying 'application module' window without clicking 'Generate Code and Close', your manually entered static values will be discarded.</p>
                        <h5>Unsupported MySQL Database Column / Field Types</h5>
                        <p>CodeIgniter Wizard does not support some advanced field types such as "Geometry" and "BLOB" with a tiny exception: If you store images in a BLOB field (or one of its derivatives) and if your field name contains one of the words "photo", "picture" or "image", CodeIgniter Wizard will create an <img /> tag with the <code>src</code> pointing to the BASE64 decoded binary data in list views only, when you use a standard (non-resource) controller. Aside from that, "include in forms" and "include in grid" checkboxes will be disabled for "Geometry" and "BLOB" (and their derivative) fields.</p>


                        <h4 class="help-subtopic" id="creating" class="help-subtopic">Editing Generated Translation Keys and Values</h4>
                        <h5>Localization of Modules (i18n)</h5>
                        <picture> <source type="image/webp" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/editTranslatedString-light-normal.webp" /> <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/editTranslatedString-light-large.png" /> <img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/editTranslatedString-light-large.png" alt="Editing Generated Translation Keys and Values" /></picture>
                        <p>If your application has localization enabled, every module you generate will also create a corresponding translation file containing a set of localized strings for each field as well as certain phrases like "a record has successfully been created" or "an error occurred".</p>
                        <p>For languages other than English, you will need to edit the translated strings so as to include the corresponding string values for that language.</p>
                        <p>After you publish a module, you can observe that under app/Language directory, the languages you have added will appear in sub-driectories (sub-folders) named with the locale or the short, two-letter code of the language with all the translation files created under them containing them as strings in an associative PHP array.</p>
                        <p>Note that for every language, a translation file called Basic containing a parent key named "global" will also have been created containing child translation key-value pairs for localized strings used throughout the generated view files.</p>
                        <p>You can also edit the generated translation files in a PHP IDE, but you probably will never need to.</p>

                        <h4 class="help-subtopic">Generated code is output to PHP files by publishing modules.</h4>

                        <picture> <source type="image/webp" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/codeigniter-wiz2-modules-dark-normal.webp" /> <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/codeigniter-wiz2-modules-dark-normal.png" /> <img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/res/kul/codeigniter-wiz2-modules-dark-normal.png" alt="Modules in CodeIgniter 2.0" /> </picture>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1em;">The modules you have previously created are kept as meta-data in CodeIgniter Wizard's internal database. Once one or multiple modules are created, you can publish them right away. Publishing means writing model (as well as entity), controller and associated views to PHP files in your Mac's file system under appropriate sub directories inside your web application folder on disk.</p>
                        <p>You can now select the module from the modules list and click "Publish". This will write a set of files in your web application folder including the model, the entity, the controller classes and all the associated views.</p>
                        <p style="color: red;"><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Please note that 'publishing' will overwrite all the code files which CodeIgniter Wizard has generated, previously saved in your web application folder.</strong></span></p>
                        <p>Therefore you are advised not to start customizing any of the automatically generated code in an external code editor or IDE before you are done creating and publishing your entire web app in CodeIgniter Wizard.</p>
                        <p style="color: green;">The recommended way is to manually copy the generated folder to your development environment and do your customizations in an IDE such as Netbeans, PHPStorm or Visual Studio Code, etc.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively you can only download the code file(s) containing the MVC component by clicking the corresponding 'download' button. This should especially be useful in cases where you had already published your web application, copied it to work on it further with an IDE, and now doing incremental development upon the initial base.</p>
                        <p><strong>Publishing all modules</strong> will also create or update the sidebar and the dashboard home page.</p>
                        <h5>Seeing it in Action</h5>
                        <p>First, make sure the database server is up an running and accessible. Open Terminal and change directory to your web application's root folder. Then run the following command:</p>

                        <pre><code>php spark serve</code></pre>
                        <p><img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/ciwres/helpres/shrd/run.png" class="img-fluid mb-3" /></p>
                        <p>Alternatively, if you had a web server and your web application in a configured (servable) directory, just start your web server with your generated web application published on it.</p>
                        <p>Finally, open a browser and type in the URL formed in the following pattern:</p>
                        <pre><code>http://yourappbaseurl/controllername</code></pre>
                        <p>You can get the look and feel of your module like this, and edit it back in CodeIgniter Wizard if needed.</p>
                        <aside>
                            <p>If you are lost in the URL scheme, you can try publishing all modules, and then just go to the base URL of your application where you will have about all the navigation links in place to find your way across all the view controllers of your application.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p><a name="publishall"></a></p>
                        <h5>Publishing All Modules</h5>
                        <p>Publishing all modules will not only write all the MVC class and view file code from all of your modules, but also populate your web application's sidebar with links to each of the modules, and will create a sample dashboard home page with widgets with links to the modules.</p>
                        <img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/ciwres/helpres/shrd/publishallconfirmationBigSur.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block mb-4" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

                        <h5>Running Your Web App and Accessing it in a Web Browser</h5>
                        <p>Once you make sure the database server is up an running and accessible, you can open Terminal and change directory to your web application's root folder. Then run the following command:</p>
                        <code>
                                php spark serve
                            </code><img href="/ozarnetstaticweb/ciwres/helpres/shrd/run.png" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="image" />
                        <p>For this to work, make sure you have set up a local PHP development environment that <a href="#requirements">meets the requirements of the CodeIgniter framework</a>. We also have a <a href="/ozarnetstaticweb/blog/web-development-php/how-to-install-php8-macos-big-sur-with-homebrew" title="How to Install PHP 8 to macOS Big Sur Using Homebrew">tutorial in this blog post</a> showing how to accomplish this with Homebrew.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, if you had a web server and your web application in a configured (servable) directory, just start your web server with your generated web application published on it.</p>
                        <p>Finally, open a browser and type in the URL formed in the following pattern:</p>
                        <p><code>http://yourappbaseurl/controllername</code></p>
